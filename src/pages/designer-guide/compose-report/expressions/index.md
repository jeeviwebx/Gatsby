Expressions provide great flexibility to control the content, style, data, value and behavior of your reports. Expressions must start with equal sign (=), if not the value will be considered as a string literal.

## Supported Expressions

The supported expression types and functions details are listed in the following table:

|References|Description|Example
|----|-----|-----|

|[Functions](./../../compose-report/expressions/using-built-in-functions/)|Functions in an expressions is used to perform some basic functions like datetime, math, aggregate, text functions, conversion functions.|`=Round(1.3*5)/5`|
|[Parameters](./../../compose-report/expressions/using-report-parameters/)|Represents the collection of report parameters, each of which with a parameter value.|`Parameters!ReportParameter1.Value`|
|[Dataset Fields](./../../compose-report/expressions/using-dataset-fields/)|Represents dataset fields collections in reports with dataset field value.|`Fields!EmployeeID.Value,"DataSet1"`|
