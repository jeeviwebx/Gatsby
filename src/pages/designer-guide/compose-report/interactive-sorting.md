# Interactive sorting

Interactive sorting can be used to enable a user to toggle between ascending and descending order dynamically in the Report Viewer by setting interactive sorting on a `TextBox` report item within a data region.

## Create data

To present data in the table, create a dataset and bind data to the table data region. In this designing section, the following dataset query is used for dataset creation.

```sql
SELECT PC.Name AS ProdCat, PS.Name AS SubCat, DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderYear, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderQtr,SUM(SOD.UnitPrice * SOD.OrderQty) AS Sales
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory PS INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD ON SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID INNER JOIN
Production.Product P ON SOD.ProductID = P.ProductID ON PS.ProductSubcategoryID = P.ProductSubcategoryID INNER JOIN
Production.ProductCategory PC ON PS.ProductCategoryID = PC.ProductCategoryID
WHERE (SOH.OrderDate BETWEEN '1/1/2002' AND '12/31/2003')
GROUP BY DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate), PC.Name, PS.Name, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate), PS.ProductSubcategoryID
```

> Refer [Create Data](./../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section and create dataset using the above query. `AdventuresWorks` database is used here.

## Add interactive sorting

Design a [simple table report](./../../design-rdl-report-in-web-report-designer/#add-table-report-item) as shown below.

![Table design](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/compose-report/interactive-sorting/table-design.png '#width=300px')

Select the column header textbox of the column to which you want to enable interactive sorting. Here, lets add interactive sorting on the `Product Category` column.

![Select column header](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/compose-report/interactive-sorting/select-column-header.png)

In `User Sort` property, set the interactive sorting using following fields:

![Sorting properties](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/compose-report/interactive-sorting/sorting-properties.png '#width=350px')

* **Sort Expression**: Available fields in the assigned data set will be listed in the `Sort Expression` field. Select the expression containing the value of the field on which you want to provide sorting.
   ![Sorting properties](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/compose-report/interactive-sorting/sort-expression-field.png '#width=350px')
* **Sort Expression Scope**: Available details, row and column grouping in the respective data region will be listed in the `Sort Expression Scope` field.
    * To enable the interactive sorting on `Details Row` then choose details group.
    * To enable the interactive sorting on `Grouping Column` then choose the group.
      ![Sorting properties](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/compose-report/interactive-sorting/sort-scope.png '#width=350px')
* **Sort Target**: Select the grouping level or data region within the report to sort.
   ![Sorting properties](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/compose-report/interactive-sorting/sort-target.png '#width=350px')

> By default sorting will be applied to the current scope, you can optionally choose a different scope in `Sort Expression Scope` and `Sort Target` fields.

## Preview

On report preview, interactive sorting button will be enabled in the respective column header.

Click on the arrow icon to sort the column dynamically in ascending or descending order.
