Currency type has the following options:

* **Decimal Places** is used to round off the number of decimal digits in numeric values.

* **Negative Values** is used to specify the representation of negative numbers.

* **Representation** is used to display value  in Thousands, Millions, or Billions.

   For example, if the field value is 1,789,905,394 and you select Billions and specify 2 decimal places, the value displayed in the report is `1.78`.

* **Currency Culture** is used to prefix the currency symbol in field value based on the selected culture.
