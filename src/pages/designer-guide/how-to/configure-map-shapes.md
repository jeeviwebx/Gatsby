# How to configure custom map shapes

In on-premise server, we can configure the custom shape data to visualize it on map report item. To add custom shape data into on-premise application and use it report designer follow the below steps.

## Place custom shape data file in installed location

In on-premise application, build-in shape data files are located at,

<span style="font-weight:bold">Version below 3.1</span>

`{Installed_location}\Bold Reports\Report Server\ReportService\bin\ShapeData`.

![Shape data installed location](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/installed-location.png '#width=350px')

<span style="font-weight:bold">Version above 3.1</span>

`{Installed_location}\BoldServices\reporting\reportservice\ShapeData`.

![Shape data installed location](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/version-installed-location.png '#width=350px')

Copy your shape data file and paste at this location. For example, **storelocations.js**

<span style="font-weight:bold">Version below 3.1</span>

![Shape data installed location](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/add-new-file.png '#width=350px')

<span style="font-weight:bold">Version above 3.1</span>

![Shape data installed location](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/version-add-new-file.png '#width=350px')

## Add file entry

Once you paste the file in mentioned location, open mapshapes.txt file which is available in same location.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Version below 3.1</span>

![Shape data installed location](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/map-shapes-file.png '#width=350px')

<span style="font-weight:bold">Version above 3.1</span>

![Shape data installed location](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/version-map-shapes-file.png '#width=350px')

Add the entry of your file name and display name as shown below and save the file,

![Shape data installed location](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/add-entry.png '#width=350px')

## Visualize shape data on map

1. Launch the on-premise application and [create a new report](https://help.boldreports.com/enterprise-reporting/designer-guide/manage-content/reports/create-report/#steps-to-create-a-report).
   ![New report](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/new-report.png '#width=450px')
2. Drag a map into design area from item panel.
   ![New report](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/add-map.png)
3. The newly added shape data entry will be listed in the **Shapes** property drop-down under **Basic Settings** category.
   ![Shapes property](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/how-to/configure-map-shapes/shapes-property.png '#width=350px')

Refer [Design a rdl report using map](./../../report-items/map/use-case/design-map-using-custom-rule/) section to visualize shape data and analytical data using map report item.
