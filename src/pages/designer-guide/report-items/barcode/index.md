# Barcode

A barcode report item is used for representing data in a visual, machine-readable form. You can build reports that display a barcode to make tasks like tracking shipping orders and employee identification numbers easier.

## One-Dimensional barcodes

One-Dimensional barcodes represents data in the widths and spacings of printed parallel lines, which is why they are also called as linear barcodes or symbolics. Linear barcodes are read in one direction (horizontally). Linear symbolics allows the coding of small amounts of information content (a maximum of 20-30 digits or symbols).

### Adding a one dimensional barcode to the report

1. One-dimensional barcode report item is listed in the item panel under the `Barcodes` category.
   ![Barcodes listed in item panel](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/barcode-item-in-item-panel.png '#width=245px')
2. Drag and drop the 1-D barcode report item into the design area from the item panel.
   ![Drag and drop barcode report item into design area](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/drag-and-drop-1D-barcode.png '#width=425px')
3. Once you drop the barcode item into design area, respective item properties will be listed the properties panel.

### Properties

Properties required to generate 1D barcodes are listed under the `Basic Settings` category in the properties panel.

![Barcode item with properties view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/1D-basic-settings.png '#width=385px')

<span style="font-weight:bold">Symbology Type</span>

The list of supported 1D barcode symbologies are provided in the `Symbology Type` drop-down list.

![Barcode item with properties view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/symbology-types.png '#width=385px')

To change the type of existing 1D barcode in the report, select the specific barcode item and choose the symbology type in the drop-down. Now, the respective 1D barcode type will be rendered in the report design.

![Barcode item with properties view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/symbology-design.png '#width=385px')

<span style="font-weight:bold">Text</span>

`Text` property can be used to specify the value to be encoded in the barcode.

Each barcode type requires different type and length of input values for encoding, so provide the valid values based on the respective 1D barcode type. Supported barcode types and their valid input values are listed in the [Supported Barcode Types](./../../report-items/barcode/supported-barcode-types/) section.
If you provide invalid values, the error message will be displayed in the barcode item as below,

![Barcode item with properties view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/invalid-encoding.png '#width=385px')

You can also encode the values in barcodes dynamically by using the `Expressions`.

![Barcode item with properties view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/1D-barcode-expression-menu.png '#width=355px')

In the expression builder, create expression using built-in-functions or data fields and click `OK`.

![Barcode item with properties view](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/1D-expression-demo.png)

Now, the expression value will encoded in the barcode at run-time. Refer [Set Expression](./../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Text Visibility</span>

The `Text Visibility` property can be used to show/hide the label text of the barcode. The label shows a value of the barcode. In the below snaps, the `Code39` barcode with and without label text is displayed.

## Two-Dimensional barcodes

Two-dimensional (2D) barcodes are used for coding large amounts of information in a bar code, potentially up to several pages worth. Such a barcode would consist of square cells, dots, hexagons, and other geometrical figures.

### Adding a two dimensional barcode to the report

1. Two-dimensional barcode report item is listed in the item panel under the `Barcodes` category.
   ![Barcodes listed in item panel](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/2D-barcode-item-in-item-panel.png '#width=245px')
2. Drag and drop the 2-D barcode report item into the design area from the item panel.
   ![Drag and drop barcode report item into design area](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/barcode/drag-and-drop-2D-barcode.png '#width=410px')
3. Once you drop the barcode item into design area, respective item properties will be listed the properties panel.
