# Marker settings

A marker identifies a location on a map. By default, a marker uses a standard icons. We can set background color, border, style, size and tooltip for it.

> When you apply any of the marker color rules or template rule, it will take precedence over basic marker settings.

## Define marker settings

Marker settings can be applied when you have matched the map shapes based on shape data and analytical data from a data set field or from a spatial data source field.

These properties are listed under **Marker Settings** in the map properties. To enable/disable marker in the map surface, toggle the `Enable Marker` checkbox.

Once you enable the marker, other properties required for defining marker will start displaying under **Marker Settings** category and by default **Circle** marker will be applied on the map surface as shown in below,

You can also apply background color based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.
