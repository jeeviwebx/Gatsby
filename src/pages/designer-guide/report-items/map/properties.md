# Properties

Refer the [Properties panel](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/) section before proceeding with the below properties.

## Basic Settings

![Data category](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/map/over-view/basic-settings.png '#width=345px')

### Shapes

A map layer can display either a build-in or custom shape data. The `Shapes` property will display the build-in and custom shapes that are available for the report.

![Map shapes](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/map/over-view/shapes.png '#width=345px')

To import custom shape files into Report Designer, refer [Import shape files](./../../../how-to/configure-map-shapes/) section. Choose the required shape data from the drop-down to render the respective map in design area.

### Dataset

This property is used to assign the dataset to the map. The available datasets in the report will be listed in the `Dataset` property dropdown. You can choose the desired dataset from the drop-down.

> Each map report item can only show data from one dataset.

![Data category](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/map/over-view/data-set.png '#width=345px')

> Refer [Create Data](./../../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section to add dataset to your report.

### Binding data

To display analytical data on the map surface, first we need to link the analytical and shape data. The shape data is the map itself, whereas the analytical data is the data set we created. The analytical data provides meaning to the shape data. To bind analytical and shape data, refer to the [Binding Data](./../../../report-items/map/binding-data/) section.

### Filter

Filters is used to filter the data in the map. To open the `Filter` dialog, click on the `Set Filters...` button. Now, the filter dialog will be opened like below.

![Filter Dialog](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/map/over-view/filters.png '#width=345px')

Refer [Filter Data](./../../../compose-report/filter-data/) section to add/remove filters in the filter dialog.

### Groups

You can group the map elements with analytical data using this option. To open the `Grouping` dialog, click on the `Set Groups...` button in the properties panel. Now, the `Grouping` dialog will be opened like below.

![Grouping Dialog](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/map/over-view/grouping.png '#width=345px')

Using the background color property you can color the map background. To set background color using properties panel refer [Background color](./../../../compose-report/common-properties/#background-color) section.

### Projection type

A projection is a set of rules that draws geographical data in two dimensional view onto a planar surface by transforming longitude/latitude coordinates to 2D coordinates. This property must be specified when shape data is geographic.

### Custom attributes

This property can be used to set the values for map custom properties. To create and assign values for custom properties using properties panel refer [Custom Properties](./../../../compose-report/common-properties/#custom-properties) section.

### Tooltip

Tooltip property can be used to display informative text or value, when the user hovers over on the report item in report preview. To set tooltip for table report item using properties panel refer [Tooltip](./../../../compose-report/common-properties/#tooltip) section.

#### Custom Style

The `Custom Style` property enables the use of external CSS for styling report items, providing enhanced flexibility beyond the built-in styling options. This property allows you to meet specific design requirements and maintain consistent styling across multiple reports. For a step-by-step guide on setting up custom styles in your report, check the **How To** section of this guide.

## Set expression

An expression can be set to few properties of the map report item to process the property values based on expressions. To set expressions to the map report item properties, refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) section.

## Reset expression

To `Reset` the expression applied to a property, refer [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section.

## Advanced properties

Few properties of the map report items contains nested properties. To open and handle nested properties, refer [Advanced Properties](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#advanced-properties) section.
