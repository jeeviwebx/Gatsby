# Merge Cells

In tablix data regions, two or more adjacent cells can be merged into a single cell to improve the appearance or to provide spanning labels for column groups and row groups.

## Merge restrictions

The cells in the each area of a data region can be merged within the respective areas. Following are the some of the restrictions when merging the cells in tablix data region:

* Cannot merge a cell in the corner area of data region with a cell in the row group area. Cross boundary merge is not allowed.
* In body area, the cells can only be merged in the horizontal direction and not in vertical direction.
* In corner area, the cells can be merged in horizontally across columns or vertically down rows at a time.

## Merge cells
