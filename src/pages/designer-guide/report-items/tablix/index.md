# Tablix

Tablix report item is used to display paginated report data from a dataset in cells that are organized into rows and columns. It is the combination of `Table`, `Matrix`, and `List` report items `(Table + Matrix + List = Tablix)`. The `Tablix` report items are listed under `Data Regions` category in the item panel.

> Matrix report item is not provided as separate report item. The table report item can be used to create a matrix layout.

The following section explains about these report items.

## Table

Table can be used to display data in tabular format. A simple table design contains a table header row, and a details row with three columns. Table can have only row groups.

## Matrix

Matrix can be used to display summarized data. It can have row groups and column groups. A simple matrix design contains a row group, a column group, a corner cell, and a data cell.

## List

List report item can be used to create free-form layouts. It acts as a container to place multiple report items side by side to design a free-form layout.

## Tablix sections

Tablix data region can be classified into four sections:

* Corner cell - It is created when tablix data region has both row groups and column groups.
* Row group cells - Displays group instance values
* Column group cells - Displays group instance values
* Body cells - Displays detail and group data

 The following snap shows the areas for a tablix region with nested row groups and column groups

![Tablix areas](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix/tablix-areas.png '#width=410px')

> The tablix body area always exists in the tablix data region. The other areas are optional.

### Groups and total

When you select a tablix cell, row and column grippers and group indicators inside the tablix data region will show the groups to which the respective cell belongs.

The following snap shows a matrix with both row and column groups, and a total row and a total column.
