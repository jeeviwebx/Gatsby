# Insert or Delete a Row Group

You can add row groups in the table to display data in a visual hierarchy. You can create both nested groups and adjacent groups. Row group can be added either using the cell context menu or using the group menu provided in grouping panel. In cell context menu the `Row Group` option will be shown only if there is a possibility to add row group in the respective place.

## Insert a row group

In tablix data region the data can be grouped using the following options:

* Parent Group
* Child Group
* Adjacent Group

The parent and child group are used for creating a hierarchy, the groups depend on each other. While the adjacent grouping functionality can be used to create separate groupings in the same table.

### Parent row group

To add a first row group in the basic tablix structure follow the below steps.

1. Select the tablix data region in the design area, now the `Grouping Panel` will be enabled in the design view.
   ![Enable grouping panel](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/select-tablix-data-region-in-design-area.png '#width=425px')
   > To add first row group in the basic tablix structure, use the group menu in grouping panel.
2. To add a  group, go to `Row Groups` pane in grouping panel and open the context menu on the `Details` group field.
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/open-context-menu-in-details-group.png '#width=385px')
3. From the context menu, click on `Parent Group...` option under `Add Group` category.
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/click-on-parent-group-option.png '#width=385px')
4. Once you click on the `Parent Group` option, a `Tablix Group` dialog will be opened to configure the grouping.
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/tablix-group-dialog.png '#width=385px')
    * **Group By**: Based on the dataset assigned to the tablix region, dataset fields will be listed in this drop-down or else click on the square icon to create an expression.
    * **Add Group Header**: Enable this option to add a header to this group
    * **Add Group Footer**: Enable this option to add a footer to this group
5. Here, `Product Category` field is chosen as parent group in tablix data region. Click on the `OK` button
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/assign-field-for-parent-group.png '#width=385px')

Now, a new column will be added to the right side of the detail group in tablix data region and a new group member will be added above the `Detail` group of `Row Groups` pane in grouping panel hierarchical view.

### Child row group

To sub categorize the data in tablix data region you can add child group to the tablix. Now, to add the child group we can either use the cell menu or group menu in grouping panel. In the following steps child group is added using cell menu.

1. Select and right click in the row group cell to which you need to add a child group.
2. In the cell menu, click on the `Child Group` under the `Row Group` category.

3. Once you click on the `Child Group` option, a `Tablix Group` dialog will be opened to configure the grouping.
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/tablix-group-dialog.png '#width=355px')

   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/assign-field-for-child-group.png '#width=385px')

Now, a new column will be added to the right side of the `Product Category` row group in tablix data region and a new field will be added below of the `Product Category` group in hierarchical view of `Row Groups` pane in grouping panel.

![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/add-child-group-in-row-group.png '#width=385px')

On report preview, product names will be categorized based on the product type.

Download the above report design from [link](https://github.com/boldreports/resources/tree/master/docs/report-designer/tablix/insert-or-delete-a-row-group-ssrs.rdl).

### Adjacent row group

To create multiple groupings in a tablix data region adjacent grouping can be used. The adjacent row group can be added above/before or below/after of the existing group in the data region. Now, to add the adjacent group we can either use the cell menu or group menu in grouping panel. Follow the below steps to add a adjacent group.

1. Select and right click in the a row group cell to which you need to create a adjacent group.

2. Click on `Adjacent Above` to create a new group before the existing group or `Adjacent Below` to create a new group after the existing group.
3. Once you click on the `Adjacent Above` or `Adjacent Below` option, a `Tablix Group` dialog will be opened to configure the grouping.
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/tablix-group-dialog.png '#width=355px')
4. Choose the required dataset field in the `Group by` field and click on the `OK` button.

Now, a new row group will be created above or below the existing group in the tablix data region.

> To add adjacent group using group menu in grouping panel, refer [Add adjacent group](./../../../report-items/tablix/grouping-panel/#add-adjacent-group) section.

## Delete row group

Row group can be deleted either using the cell context menu or using the group menu provided in grouping panel.

1. Select and right click on a row group which you want to delete from the tablix data region.
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/delete-row-group-menu.png '#width=385px')
2. In the cell menu, click on the `Delete Row Group` option. Now, the following confirmation dialog will be launched.
   ![Open group menu](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix-insert-or-delete-group/delete-row-group-dialog.png '#width=355px')
3. In the `Delete Group` dialog choose one of the following options and click on the `OK` button.
    * **Delete group and related rows and columns** - Choose this option to delete the group and all related rows that display group data. For the details group, if the same row belongs to both detail and group data, only the detail data rows are deleted.
    * **Delete group only** - Choose this option to keep the structure of the tablix data region and delete only the group definition.

Now, the respective group information will be deleted from the tablix data region.
