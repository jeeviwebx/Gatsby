# Insert or Delete a Column Group

You can add column groups in the table to display data in a visual hierarchy. You can create both nested groups and adjacent groups. Column group can be added either using the cell context menu or using the group menu provided in grouping panel. In cell context menu the `Column Group` option will be shown only if there is a possibility to add column group in the respective place.

## Insert a column group

In tablix data region the data can be grouped using the following options:

* Parent Group
* Child Group
* Adjacent Group

The parent and child group are used for creating a hierarchy, the groups depend on each other. While the adjacent grouping functionality can be used to create separate groupings in the same table.

### Parent column group

To add a first column group in the basic tablix structure follow the below steps.

1. Select and right click in the cell to which you need to add a parent child group.

3. Once you click on the `Parent Group` option, a `Tablix Group` dialog will be opened to configure the grouping.
