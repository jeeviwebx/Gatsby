A user can click the content in the list, to navigate to the report page that displays that item. Refer [Document Map](./../../compose-report/document-map/) section to configure document map in the report design.

You can set the static or dynamic text as value for document map property. To set and reset dynamic text, refer [Set Expression](./../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section.

Bookmark links allows the users to navigate to different parts of a SSRS report. You can add bookmarks to each textbox, image, table or chart or to the unique group values displayed in a tablix which can direct the users to specified locations in the report. The value of bookmark property can be your own strings or an expression. Refer [Bookmark](./../../compose-report/bookmark/) section to configure bookmark in the report design.

The `Custom Style` property enables the use of external CSS for styling report items, providing enhanced flexibility beyond the built-in styling options.
