# Funnel Chart

The **Funnel Chart** control shows values across multiple stages in a process by highlighting different stages with different colors. It allows you to make proportional comparisons between values showcased in a progressively decreasing manner.

## Add chart to the report

These types of charts are categorized under the `Proportion` category in the item panel.

Drag and drop the funnel chart from the item panel into the design area.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/funnel-chart/drag-a-chart-from-item-panel.png '#width=245px')

Now, the funnel chart will be rendered in the design area and the chart properties will be listed in the properties panel.

## Create data

To present data in the chart, create a dataset and bind data to the chart data region. In this designing section, the following json data is used for dataset creation.

```json
[
      { "Country":"China", "Population":1409517397 },
      { "Country":"India", "Population":1339180127 },
      { "Country":"UnitedStates", "Population":324459463 },
      { "Country":"Indonesia", "Population":263991379 },
      { "Country":"Brazil", "Population":209288278 },
      { "Country":"Pakistan", "Population":197015955 },
      { "Country":"Nigeria", "Population":190886311 },
      { "Country":"Bangladesh", "Population":164669751 },
      { "Country":"Russia", "Population":143989754 },
      { "Country":"Mexico", "Population":129163276 },
      { "Country":"Japan", "Population":127484450 },
      { "Country":"Ethiopia", "Population":104957438 },
      { "Country":"Philippines", "Population":104918090 },
      { "Country":"Egypt", "Population":97553151 },
      { "Country":"Vietnam", "Population":95540800 },
      { "Country":"Germany", "Population":82114224 }
]
```

> Refer to the [Create Data](./../../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section for more information. Here, we are going to create a dataset using [JSON inline data](./../../../manage-data/data-connectors/json-data-source/#inline-data) to design the report.

## Assign data

The **Funnel Chart** needs a minimum of one value element and one column element to showcase. The measure or expression field that you want to analyze can be dropped into the `Y Value(s)` section. The dimension for which you want to categorize the measure can be dropped into the `Column` section. To categorize the measure based on a series, drop the respective dimension into the `Row(s)` section.

To configure data into a funnel chart, follow the steps:

1. To bind data to a chart report item placed in the design area, focus on that report item.

2. Click the `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to the `DATA` tab.

   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/funnel-chart/chart-properties-pane.png '#width=425px')

3. The available data in the report will be listed in the dropdown, choose a data in the dropdown list.

   ![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/funnel-chart/data-assign-drop-down.png '#width=385px')

4. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other types of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.

   ![Measures and dimensions](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/funnel-chart/measures-dimensions-category.png '#width=385px')

5. **Drag and Drop Measure Element**:

   Select and drag the numeric column (measure element) or the numeric expression column from the `Measure` section and drop it in the `Y Values` section.

   ![Add a Y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/funnel-chart/add-y-values-field.png '#width=385px')

   Now, the report item design will look like below:

8. **Grouping**:

   You can also group the added column element with another column, by adding the respective dimension element into the `Row(s)` section.

9. **Formatting Column and Row(s) sections**:

   You can also [Filter](./../../../compose-report/filter-data/), [Sort](./../../../compose-report/sort-data/), or [Group](./../../../compose-report/group-data/) the Column or Row(s) sections using expressions.

## Format Funnel Chart

You can format the funnel chart for better illustration of the view that you require, through the settings available in the `Properties` tab.

To format a funnel chart, follow the below steps:

1. Drag and drop the funnel chart into the design area and resize it to the required size.
