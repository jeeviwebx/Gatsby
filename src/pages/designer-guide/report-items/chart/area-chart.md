# Area Chart

Stacked Area Chart allows you to compare multiple measures through filled curves stacked one after the other vertically.

## Add chart to the report

These types of charts are categorized under the `Distribution` category in item panel.

Drag and drop area chart from the item panel into design area.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/area-chart/drag-chart-from-item-panel.png '#width=285px')

Now, the area chart will be rendered in the design area and the chart properties will be listed in properties panel.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/area-chart/initial-view-of-area-chart.png)

> Here, `Stacked Area` chart is used for demonstration.

## Create data

To present data in the chart, create a dataset and bind data to the chart data region. In this designing section, the following dataset query is used for dataset creation.

```sql
SELECT PC.Name AS ProdCat, PS.Name AS SubCat, DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderYear, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderQtr,SUM(SOD.UnitPrice * SOD.OrderQty) AS Sales
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory PS INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD ON SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID INNER JOIN
Production.Product P ON SOD.ProductID = P.ProductID ON PS.ProductSubcategoryID = P.ProductSubcategoryID INNER JOIN
Production.ProductCategory PC ON PS.ProductCategoryID = PC.ProductCategoryID
WHERE (SOH.OrderDate BETWEEN '1/1/2002' AND '12/31/2003')
GROUP BY DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate), PC.Name, PS.Name, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate), PS.ProductSubcategoryID
```

> Refer [Create Data](./../../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section and create dataset using the above query. `AdventuresWorks` database is used here.

## Assign data

Stacked Area Chart needs a minimum of 1 value element and 1 column element to showcase. The measure or expression field that you would like to analyze can be dropped into `Y Values` section. The dimension that you would like to categorize the measure, can be dropped onto `Columns` section. If you would like to categorize based on a series, then the respective dimension can be dropped onto `Rows` section in addition.

To configure data into area chart follow the steps:

1. To bind data to a chart report item placed in the design area, focus on that report item.
2. Click `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to `DATA` tab.
   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/area-chart/chart-properties-pane.png)
3. The available data in the report will be listed in the drop-down, choose a data in the drop-down list.
   ![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/data-assign-drop-down.png '#width=395px')
4. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other type of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.
