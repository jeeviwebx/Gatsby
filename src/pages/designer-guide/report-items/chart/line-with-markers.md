# Line with Markers Chart

The **Line with Markers Chart** allows you to showcase trends for analysis over a time period with data points connecting using straight lines with markers.

## Add chart to the report

These types of charts are categorized under the `Distribution` category in the item panel.

Drag and drop the line with markers chart from the item panel into the design area.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/line-with-markers/drag-chart-from-item-panel.png '#width=245px')

Now, the line with markers chart will be rendered in the design area and the chart properties will be listed in the properties panel.

## Create data

To present data in the chart, create a dataset and bind data to the chart data region. In this designing section, the following json data is used for dataset creation.

```json
[
   {
        points: [
         { Year: 2005, Percentage: 28 },{ Year: 2006, Percentage: 25 },{ Year: 2007, Percentage: 26 },{ Year: 2008, Percentage: 27 },
         { Year: 2009, Percentage: 32 },{ Year: 2010, Percentage: 35 },{ Year: 2011, Percentage: 30 }],
        Country: 'India'
   },
   {
        points: [
         { Year: 2005, Percentage: 31 },{ Year: 2006, Percentage: 28 },{ Year: 2007, Percentage: 30 },{ Year: 2008, Percentage: 36 },
         { Year: 2009, Percentage: 36 },{ Year: 2010, Percentage: 39 },{ Year: 2011, Percentage: 37 }],
        Country: 'Germany'
   },
   {
        points: [
         { Year: 2005, Percentage: 36 },{ Year: 2006, Percentage: 32 },{ Year: 2007, Percentage: 34 },{ Year: 2008, Percentage: 41 },
         { Year: 2009, Percentage: 42 },{ Year: 2010, Percentage: 42 },{ Year: 2011, Percentage: 43 }],

> Refer to the [Create Data](./../../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section for more information. Here, we are going to create a dataset using [JSON inline data](./../../../manage-data/data-connectors/json-data-source/#inline-data) to design the report.

## Assign data

The **Line with Markers Chart** needs a minimum of 1 value element and 1 column element to showcase. The measure or expression field that you would like to analyze can be dropped into the `Y Value(s)` section. The dimension that you would like to categorize the measure can be dropped into the `Column` section. If you would like to categorize based on a series, then the respective dimension can be dropped onto the `Row(s)` section in addition.

To configure data into a line with markers chart, follow these steps:

1. To bind data to a chart report item placed in the design area, focus on that report item.

2. Click the `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to the `DATA` tab.

   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/line-with-markers/chart-properties-pane.png '#width=425px')

3. The available data in the report will be listed in the dropdown, choose a data in the dropdown list.

   ![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/line-with-markers/data-assign-drop-down.png '#width=385px')

4. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other types of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.
