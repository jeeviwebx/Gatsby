# Chart Series

This section explains how to customize the chart series appearance using the properties panel. You can add multiple series to the chart and the available series will be listed in the `Choose Series` drop-down.

![Series selection](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/choose-series.png '#width=385px')

In the below snap, the chart has single series.

![Chart with single series](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/chart-with-single-series.png)

So, only one series is listed in the drop-down,

![Series dropdown with single value](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/single-series-list-in-drop-down.png '#width=385px')

If the chart has multiple series as below,

![Chart with multiple series](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/chart-with-multiple-series.png)

Now, both series will be listed in the properties panel.

![Series dropdown with multiple value](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/multi-series-list-in-drop-down.png '#width=385px')

To customize the series appearance choose the required series name in the drop-down. Then click on the edit icon.

![Choose series](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/edit-option.png '#width=385px')

Now, the respective series properties will be displayed in secondary panel.

## Basic Settings

### Chart Type

Supported chart types will be listed in the `Chart Type` property dropdown. You can switch a series to required chart type based on your data presentation.

![Choose series](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/properties.png '#width=385px')

For example, the chart has two series. Both series are of column chart type.

![Same series type](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/same-series-type.png '#width=385px')

Let's choose first series and change chart type as `Line`.

![Switch chart type](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/switch-chart-type.png '#width=385px')

Now, you can see respective series is changed to line type in chart surface.

![Multi series type](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/multi-series-type.png '#width=385px')

Refer [Chart switcher](./../../../report-items/chart/switch-chart-type/) section, to customize each series using the properties panel.

### Series Border

Series border properties can be used to customize the chart series border in the design.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/series-border.png '#width=385px')

In the below design, border color, width and style properties are applied to the chart series.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/border-design.png)

You can also set properties based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expression](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/border-expression-menu.png '#width=385px')

### Series Color

Series Color property can be used to customize the series colors in the chart area. If the chart has multiple series, you can differentiate the series using this property.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/series-color-first-series.png '#width=385px')

Now, the selected color will be applied to the respective series in the chart design.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/first-series-color-design.png '#width=385px')

You can also apply series color based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

### Series Shadow

The `Shadow Color` property lets you set the color of shadows for chart elements, enhancing their appearance. The `Shadow Offset` property adjusts the distance between the chart series and their shadows, allowing for subtle or bold shadow effects.

![Chart shadow preview](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/shadow-property.png '#width=385px')

The selected shadow color and offset will be applied to the corresponding series in the chart design during preview.

You can also apply shadow properties based on dynamic values, by using the `Expressions`. Refer [Set Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#set-expression) and [Reset Expressions](./../../../compose-report/properties-panel/#reset-expression) section to open set/reset expression menu in properties panel.

## Axis Settings

Charts typically have two axes to help organize and display data more meaningfully. They can be easily visualized by presenting series data with different ranges or unit types on different axes, using primary and secondary axes.

`Primary` and `Secondary` axis options will be listed in the Category and Value property dropdown.

![Primary and Secondary axis](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/primary-and-secondary-axis-options.png '#width=385px')

If you want to showcase the number of units sold (in unit type numbers) in every month of the year along with the total sale amount (in unit type Dollars), you don’t have to compare this in two different charts. Instead, you can display the total number of units sold (in unit type numbers) on the primary y-axis and the total sale amount (in unit type Dollars) will be displayed on the secondary y-axis. This allows us to compare multiple series with different ranges on the same chart.

![Chart secondary axis](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/series/secondary-axis-series.png)

> Note: Axis settings are not applicable for `Proportion` and `KPI` chart types.

## Link

### Link To

You can configure **Hyperlink**, **Bookmark** or a **Report path** in the chart series to create an interactive report. Refer [Linking](./../../../compose-report/link-data/) section to set or reset link property for chart series.

You can customize text for all legends on your report by navigating to the series properties.
