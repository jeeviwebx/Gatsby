# Doughnut Chart

The **Doughnut Chart** allows you to showcase proportionality of each item to the total in the form of doughnut-slices. It works best to display data with a small number of categories.

## Add chart to the report

These types of charts are categorized under the `Proportion` category in the item panel.

Drag and drop the doughnut chart from the item panel into the design area.

![Chart Types](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/drag-chart-from-item-panel.png '#width=185px')

Now, the doughnut chart will be rendered in the design area and the chart properties will be listed in the properties panel.

## Create data

To present data in the chart, create a dataset and bind data to the chart data region. Here, we are going to create a dataset using [Json Data File](./../../../manage-data/data-connectors/json-data-source/#load-from-disk) to design the report. You can download sample data from the following [link](https://github.com/boldreports/resources/tree/master/docs/report-designer/data/expense-analysis.json).

> Refer to the [Create Data](./../../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section for more information.

## Assign data

The **Doughnut Chart** needs a minimum of one value element and one column element to showcase. The measure or expression field that you want to analyze can be dropped into the `Y Value(s)` section. The dimension for which you want to categorize the measure can be dropped into the `Column` section. To categorize based on a series, drop the respective dimension into the `Row(s)` section.

To configure data into a doughnut chart, follow these steps:

1. To bind data to a chart report item placed in the design area, focus on that report item.

2. Click the `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to the `DATA` tab.

   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/chart-properties-pane.png)

3. The available data in the report will be listed in the dropdown, choose a data in the dropdown list.

   ![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/data-assign-drop-down.png '#width=385px')

4. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other types of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.

   ![Measures and dimensions](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/measures-dimensions-category.png '#width=385px')

5. **Drag and Drop Measure Element**:

   Select and drag the numeric column (measure element) or the numeric expression column from the `Measure` section and drop it in the `Y Value(s)` section.

   ![Add a Y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/add-y-values-field.png '#width=385px')

   Now, the report item design will look like below:

   ![Preview after adding y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/y-value-chart-design-view.png '#width=385px')

6. **Aggregate Options**:

   Click the `Settings` icon (highlighted below) to open the aggregation type dropdown list.

   ![Aggregate settings icon](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/aggregation-settings-icon.png '#width=185px')

   You can set the aggregation type by which you can compute the selected column.

   ![Aggregate menu list](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/aggregation-settings-menu.png '#width=385px')

7. **Drag and Drop Dimension Element**:

   Select and drag the dimension element from the `Dimensions` section to measure against any of the selected numeric column(s) in the `Y Value(s)` section, and drop it into the `Column` section.

   ![Add dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/add-field-to-column-section.png '#width=385px')

   Now, the report item design will look like below:

   ![Preview after adding dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/chart/doughnut-chart/column-field-design-preview.png '#width=385px')

8. **Grouping**:

   You can also group the added column element with another column by adding the respective dimension element into the Row(s) section.

9. **Formatting Column and Row(s) sections**:

   You can also [Filter](./../../../compose-report/filter-data/), [Sort](./../../../compose-report/sort-data/), or [Group](./../../../compose-report/group-data/) the Column or Row(s) sections using expressions.

## Format Doughnut Chart

You can format the doughnut chart for better illustration of the view that you require, through the settings available in the `Properties` tab.

To format a doughnut chart, follow the below steps:

1. Drag and drop the doughnut chart into the design area and resize it to the required size.
2. Configure the data to the doughnut chart.
3. Focus on the doughnut chart and click the `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens.

#### Custom Style

The `Custom Style` property enables the use of external CSS for styling report items, providing enhanced flexibility beyond the built-in styling options. This property allows you to meet specific design requirements and maintain consistent styling across multiple reports. For a step-by-step guide on setting up custom styles in your report, check the **How To** section of this guide.
