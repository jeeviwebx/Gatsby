# Linear gauge

Linear gauges are rectangular in shape and oriented horizontally or vertically. These can be placed inside the `Tablix` and `Matrix`.

## Add a linear gauge to the report

1. The linear gauge report item is listed in the item panel under the `Deviation` category.

2. Drag the linear gauge report item into the design area from the item panel.

#### Document Map

A document map is a navigational feature that displays a separate side pane with set of navigational links in hierarchical structure when you view a report. A user can click the content in the list, to navigate to the report page that displays that item. Refer [Document Map](./../../../compose-report/document-map/) section to configure document map in the report design.

#### Custom Style

The `Custom Style` property enables the use of external CSS for styling report items, providing enhanced flexibility beyond the built-in styling options. This property allows you to meet specific design requirements and maintain consistent styling across multiple reports. For a step-by-step guide on setting up custom styles in your report, check the **How To** section of this guide.
