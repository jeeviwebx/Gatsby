# Data bar

Data bars are small, simple charts which can be used for showing trends and changes in data over time, especially over many periods.
They convey a lot of information in a little space, often used in table and matrices.

## Add data bar to the report

1. The data bar report item is listed in the item panel under the `KPI` category.
   ![Data bar item in item panel](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/data-bar/item-panel.png '#width=145px')
2. Drag and drop the data bar report item into the design area or inside tablix cell from the item panel.
   ![Drag and drop data bar report item into design area](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/data-bar/item-drag.png '#width=355px')
3. After dropping the data bar item in the design area or inside tablix cell, the respective item properties will be listed in the properties panel.

## Create data

To present data in the data bar, create a dataset and bind data to it. In this designing section, the following dataset query is used for dataset creation.

```sql
SELECT PC.Name AS ProdCat, PS.Name AS SubCat, DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderYear, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderQtr,SUM(SOD.UnitPrice * SOD.OrderQty) AS Sales
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory PS INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD ON SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID INNER JOIN
Production.Product P ON SOD.ProductID = P.ProductID ON PS.ProductSubcategoryID = P.ProductSubcategoryID INNER JOIN
Production.ProductCategory PC ON PS.ProductCategoryID = PC.ProductCategoryID
GROUP BY DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate), PC.Name, PS.Name, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate), PS.ProductSubcategoryID
```

> Refer [Create Data](./../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section and create dataset using the above query. `AdventuresWorks` database is used here.

## Assign data

Data bar needs a minimum of 1 value element to showcase data. The measure or expression field that you would like to analyze can be dropped into `Y Values` section. The dimension that you would like to categorize the measure, can be dropped onto `Columns` section. If you would like to categorize based on a series, then the respective dimension can be dropped onto `Rows` section in addition.

To configure data into data bar follow the below steps:

1. To bind data to a data bar report item, focus on that report item.
2. Click `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to `DATA` tab.
   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/data-bar/chart-properties-pane.png)
3. The available data in the report will be listed in the drop-down, choose a data in the drop-down list.
   ![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/data-bar/data-assign-drop-down.png '#width=385px')
4. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other type of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.
