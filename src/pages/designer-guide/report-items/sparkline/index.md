# Sparkline

Sparklines are small, simple charts which can be used for showing trends and changes in data over time, especially over many periods.
They represents multiple data points, often used in table and matrices.

## Add sparkline to the report

1. The sparkline report item is listed in the item panel under the `KPI` category.
   ![Sparkline item in item panel](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/item-panel.png '#width=125px')
2. Drag and drop the sparkline report item into the design area or inside tablix cell from the item panel.
   ![Drag and drop sparkline report item into design area](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/item-drag.png '#width=385px')
3. After dropping the sparkline item in the design area or inside tablix cell, the respective item properties will be listed in the properties panel.

## Create data

To present data in the sparkline, create a dataset and bind data to it. In this designing section, the following dataset query is used for dataset creation.

```sql
SELECT PC.Name AS ProdCat, PS.Name AS SubCat, DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderYear, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate) AS OrderQtr,SUM(SOD.UnitPrice * SOD.OrderQty) AS Sales
FROM Production.ProductSubcategory PS INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderHeader SOH INNER JOIN
Sales.SalesOrderDetail SOD ON SOH.SalesOrderID = SOD.SalesOrderID INNER JOIN
Production.Product P ON SOD.ProductID = P.ProductID ON PS.ProductSubcategoryID = P.ProductSubcategoryID INNER JOIN
Production.ProductCategory PC ON PS.ProductCategoryID = PC.ProductCategoryID
GROUP BY DATEPART(yy, SOH.OrderDate), PC.Name, PS.Name, 'Q' + DATENAME(qq, SOH.OrderDate), PS.ProductSubcategoryID
```

> Refer [Create Data](./../../manage-data/dataset/create-an-embedded-dataset/) section and create dataset using the above query. `AdventuresWorks` database is used here.

## Assign data

Sparkline needs a minimum of 1 value element to showcase data. The measure or expression field that you would like to analyze can be dropped into `Y Values` section. The dimension that you would like to categorize the measure, can be dropped onto `Columns` section. If you would like to categorize based on a series, then the respective dimension can be dropped onto `Rows` section in addition.

To configure data into sparkline follow the below steps:

1. To bind data to a sparkline report item, focus on that report item.
2. Click `Properties` icon in the configuration panel, the property pane opens. Now, switch to `DATA` tab.
   ![Chart properties pane](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/chart-properties-pane.png '#width=600px')
3. The available data in the report will be listed in the drop-down, choose a data in the drop-down list.
   ![Choose the dataset for chart](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/data-assign-drop-down.png '#width=315px')
4. The numeric columns and numeric expressions are listed under the `Measures` section; other type of columns and dimension expressions are listed under the `Dimensions` section.
   ![Measures and dimensions](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/measures-dimensions-category.png '#width=315px')
5. **Drag and Drop Measure Element**:
   Select and drag the numeric column (measure element) or the numeric expression column from the `Measure` section and drop it in the `Y Values` section.
   ![Add a Y-value field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/add-y-values-field.png '#width=315px')
   Now, the report item design will look like below:

6. **Aggregate Options**:
   Click the `Settings` icon (highlighted below) to open the aggregation type drop-down list.
   ![Aggregate settings icon](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/aggregation-settings-icon.png '#width=245px')
   You can set the aggregation type by which you can compute the selected column.
   ![Aggregate menu list](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/aggregation-settings-menu.png '#width=315px')
7. **Drag and Drop Dimension Element**:
   Select and drag the dimension element from the `Dimensions` section to measure against any of the selected numeric column(s) in `Y Value(s)` section, and drop into the `Column(s)` section.  
   ![Add dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/add-field-to-column-section.png '#width=315px')
   Now, the report item design will look like below:
   ![Preview after adding dimension field](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/column-field-design-preview.png '#width=245px')
8. **Grouping**:
   You can group the added column element with another column, by adding the respective dimension element into Row(s) section.
   ![Achieve grouping by row values](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/sparkline/add-field-to-rows-section.png '#width=315px')
   Now, the report item design will look like below.
