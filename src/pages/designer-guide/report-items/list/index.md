# List

List report item can be used to create free-form layouts. You can arrange report items to create a form with text boxes, images, and other data regions placed anywhere within the list. It acts as a container to place multiple report items side by side to design a free-form layout. A simple list design has a single cell in a row associated with the detail group and the cell contains a `Rectangle` report item.

![Tablix listed in item panel](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/tablix/initial-list-design.png '#width=165px')

By default, no group expression is defined on List. When no group expression is defined, List repeats for each row in the datasource. When a group expression is defined on a List, the List repeats for each group in the datasource.

> Like tables and matrices, list report items are implemented as a Tablix data region.

## Add report items in list

To add report items in list cell, drag report items from itempanel or data fields from the `Data` panel to the cell. By default, the cell contains a rectangle that acts as a container.

![Initial design](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/list/drag-and-drop-report-item-to-list.png '#width=385px')

Now, the report item will be dropped in the list container as shown in the below snap.

![Initial design](/static/assets/on-premise/images/report-designer/report-items/list/drag-and-drop-report-item-to-list-design.png '#width=385px')

> When you right click in the list cell, the menu that appears is respect with the cell. If you insert a report item into the cell using the `Insert` option from cell context menu, the rectangle report item in the cell will be replaced by a new report item. So, to insert items inside the list cell, drag and drop the required report item into the cell containing rectangle.

In the following snap a simple design is created using the list to display product details.

On report preview, the List repeats for each row in the datasource.
